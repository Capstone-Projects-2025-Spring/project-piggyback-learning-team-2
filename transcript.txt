Oh. Hello friends. You might be wondering what I was doing in that hole. Well, that is one of my usual trips to find something new. And guess what I found today? This is the bag of five senses. Come, let's see what's inside. Zoom in. Whoa, these are the five senses. Sense of sight, sense of hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, and sense of touch. These are the eyes. They help you see. Yes, you're using them right now while looking at me. Amazing, isn't it? Your eyes help you to see things. Just like how it will help us to see what's next. These are the years, they help you here. Do you hear that? Wonderful music, isn't it? Your ears help you hear. So whenever you hear beautiful things like birds chirping. Or a car blowing its horn. You know it's your sense of hearing. I smell something. Is it coming from the garbage bin outside? This is your nose. It helps you smell different things. It could be something stinky like the garbage or something delicious. Ah, like a mug of hot chocolate. This is your tongue. It helps you taste different kinds of food. Hey, that's a pizza. Mhm. Yummy. Whether it's spicy. Oh. Or sour mm. Sweet. Or bitter? You know it all because of the sense of taste. And this is your skin. It helps you touch and feel things. When you touch clay and touch wood, do they feel different to you? Does the clay seem soft and smooth, and the wood seems hard and rough? Your skin helps you know whether something is hot. Of gold Liquid Solid. So Or hard Remember King Midas, who was cursed that his touch would turn anything into gold. But don't worry, that's not gonna happen to you through your time. Did you know that the snakes hear from their jaw bones, and 80% of what humans experience as taste is actually smell. Now I need to go back to that hole to find out something more for you. So this is me. Coming out, tune in next time for some more fun facts.
