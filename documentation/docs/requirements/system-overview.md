# System Overview

## Project Abstract
The **Piggyback Learning 002** project aims to enhance educational content by integrating interactive learning elements directly into YouTube videos. By adding quizzes, learning materials, and feedback directly into video playback, the project seeks to engage children in an interactive and structured learning experience. The goal is to transform passive video watching into an active educational journey, where children not only consume content but also participate in learning through real-time quizzes and activities.

## Conceptual Design
The conceptual design of **Piggyback Learning 002** revolves around a seamless integration of interactive quizzes and educational materials into video content. The video content will be embedded using the **YouTube Iframe API**, while the learning materials such as quizzes and flashcards will be dynamically injected at key timestamps during playback. The system will provide real-time feedback to users, helping them to understand the material more effectively. Additionally, users will have the option to track their progress and save their results.

Key components of the conceptual design include:
- A **video player interface** powered by YouTube.
- **Dynamic quiz and material injection** at specific time codes in the video.
- **User profiles** for saving progress, quiz results, and personal preferences.
- **Real-time feedback** after quizzes for learning reinforcement.

## Background
The background of **Piggyback Learning 002** stems from the need to make learning more engaging for children through interactive content. Video-based learning has become a popular and effective way to absorb information, but it often lacks interactivity, which can reduce engagement and hinder active learning. This project aims to bridge that gap by introducing quizzes, educational materials, and interactive features into videos, providing an immersive and hands-on learning experience. By using video as a medium, the system capitalizes on the popularity of visual content while simultaneously ensuring that learning remains effective and fun.

## Core Features
### Interactive Quizzes
Quizzes are dynamically injected into the video at predefined timestamps. These quizzes are designed to engage users and assess their understanding of the material presented in the video. Users can select answers from multiple choices or enter their own responses.

### Learning Materials
Educational content such as flashcards, images, and notes are displayed alongside videos to reinforce the concepts being taught. These materials will be accessible at key moments during the video, ensuring they complement the video content.

### Progress Tracking
Users can track their progress through the video and quizzes. After each quiz or interaction, a progress bar will visually show how far along they are in the learning journey. Additionally, a summary of their performance (correct/incorrect answers) will be provided at the end of the video.

### User Profiles
Users can create accounts, log in, and save their progress. They will have access to a personal dashboard where they can view saved videos, check previous quiz results, and explore content based on their learning preferences.

### Real-Time Feedback
After completing a quiz during the video, users will immediately receive feedback on their answers. Correct answers will trigger positive reinforcement, and incorrect answers will prompt a brief explanation to help the learner understand the mistake.
