# Development Environment

## Software

### IDEs
* IntelliJ
* VSCode

### Frameworks and Programming Languages
* HTML/CSS: : These languages will be used to structure the frontend UI for the application. 
* Javascript: This language will be used for the UI as well as collecting user activity data, such as clicks and time spent on the application

* Python
   * FastAPI: Framework for the backend that will support storing and acting on user input and data
   * yolov8: Python based machine learning framework that will be used to analyze video frames to determine their contents

### Databases
* PostgreSQL: For user authentication, managing user accounts, and storing structured data like video metadata, questions, answers, and user progress. This will allow for features like saving content and tracking question progress.

* MongoDB: For tracking user activity such as time spent on each question, video playback interactions (play/pause/stop), and where they clicked within the application. Useful for logging high-volume, unstructured data.
